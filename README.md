[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An AI-powered Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive access to Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud development tools, documentation, and runtime diagnostics.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Complete SFCC Documentation Access** - Search and explore all SFCC API classes and methods
- **🏗️ SFRA Documentation** - Enhanced access to Storefront Reference Architecture documentation
- **🧱 ISML Template Reference** - Complete ISML element documentation with examples and usage guidance
- **📊 Log Analysis Tools** - Real-time error monitoring, debugging, and job log analysis for SFCC instances
- **⚙️ System Object Definitions** - Explore custom attributes and site preferences
- **🧪 Script Debugger** - Execute and inspect script-debugger endpoints in credentialed mode, including custom trigger URLs/paths for non-default storefront routes
- **🚀 Cartridge Generation** - Automated cartridge structure creation with workspace-bound path safety (writes stay inside workspace roots, or current working directory fallback when roots are unavailable; home-directory fallback is blocked)
- **🧩 Agent Skill Bootstrap** - Install or merge AGENTS.md and bundled skills into the current project or a temp directory for AI assistants
- **✅ Tool Argument Validation** - Runtime schema validation enforces required fields, type checks, enum constraints, integer/numeric bounds, and strict unknown-key checks for object schemas (top-level and nested) before handler execution
- **⏱️ MCP Progress + Cancellation** - Tool calls honor request cancellation signals and emit out-of-band `notifications/progress` updates when clients provide a `progressToken`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Documentation-Only Mode (No SFCC credentials needed)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sfcc-dev": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["sfcc-dev-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Full Mode (With SFCC credentials for log and job analysis)  
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sfcc-dev": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["sfcc-dev-mcp", "--dw-json", "/path/to/your/dw.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

Create a `dw.json` file with your SFCC credentials. You can use either auth mode (or both):
- Basic auth: `username` + `password`
- OAuth: `client-id` + `client-secret`
- Optional storefront auth (for script debugger trigger on Basic-Auth storefronts): `storefrontUsername` + `storefrontPassword`
- Optional security flag to disable the script debugger tool (arbitrary code execution): `"disable-script-debugger": true`
```json
{
  "hostname": "your-instance.sandbox.us01.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com",
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password",
  "storefrontUsername": "your-storefront-basic-user",
  "storefrontPassword": "your-storefront-basic-password",
  "client-id": "your-client-id",
  "client-secret": "your-client-secret"
}
```

At least one complete credential pair is required when `hostname` is set.
If credentials are provided, `hostname` is also required.

> **Security**: The script debugger tool (`evaluate_script`) executes arbitrary JavaScript on your SFCC instance with the configured credentials' privileges. To hard-disable it, set `"disable-script-debugger": true` in `dw.json` or `SFCC_DISABLE_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER=true` in the environment. When disabled, the tool is hidden from `tools/list` and rejected at `tools/call` with a `TOOL_NOT_AVAILABLE` error.

### Option 3: Auto-Discovery (Recommended for VS Code users)
Simply open a VS Code workspace that contains a `dw.json` file - the server will automatically discover and use it:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sfcc-dev": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["sfcc-dev-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration Discovery Priority

The server discovers SFCC credentials in this order (highest priority first):

| Priority | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **1** | `--dw-json` CLI parameter | Explicit path to dw.json file |
| **2** | Environment variables | `SFCC_HOSTNAME`, `SFCC_USERNAME`, `SFCC_PASSWORD`, `SFCC_CLIENT_ID`, `SFCC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SFCC_DISABLE_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER` (optional `true`/`false` kill switch) |
| **3** | MCP workspace roots | Automatically discovers dw.json in your VS Code workspace folder(s), and refreshes when the client sends `notifications/roots/list_changed` |

> **Note**: The server no longer searches the current working directory by default, as MCP servers often start with `cwd` set to the user's home directory. The MCP workspace roots mechanism provides reliable project context.

## 🎯 Operating Modes

| Mode | Tools Available | SFCC Credentials Required |
|------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Documentation-Only** | 18 tools | ❌ No |
| **Full Mode** | 40 tools | ✅ Yes |

### Documentation-Only Mode
Perfect for learning and development, no SFCC instance required:
- Complete SFCC API documentation (5 tools)
- SFRA documentation (5 tools)
- ISML template documentation (5 tools)
- Cartridge generation (1 tool, writes constrained to workspace roots/cwd)
- Agent instruction bootstrap (2 tools) to copy/merge AGENTS.md and skills, or disable future prompts

### Full Mode  
Complete development experience with live SFCC instance access:
- All documentation-only features (18 tools)
- Real-time log analysis and job logs (13 tools)
- System object definitions (6 tools)
- Code version management (2 tools; `activate_code_version` requires explicit user confirmation via `confirm=true`)
- Script debugger operations (1 tool, disabled when `disable-script-debugger` is set)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This server is built around a **capability-gated, modular handler architecture** that cleanly separates tool routing from domain logic:

### Core Layers
- **Tool Schemas** (`src/core/tool-schemas/`): Modular, category-based tool definitions (documentation, SFRA, ISML, logs, job logs, system objects, cartridge, code versions, agent instructions, script debugger). Re-exported via `tool-definitions.ts`.
- **Server Orchestration Modules** (`src/core/server-tool-catalog.ts`, `src/core/server-tool-call-lifecycle.ts`, `src/core/server-workspace-discovery.ts`): Keeps `server.ts` focused by extracting capability-aware tool catalog logic, `tools/call` lifecycle (progress/cancellation/preflight), and workspace roots reconfiguration flow.
- **Tool Argument Validator** (`src/core/tool-argument-validator.ts`): Enforces runtime argument shape at the MCP boundary for all tools (required fields, primitive/object/array types, enum checks, integer/numeric ranges, string patterns/length, and strict unknown-key checks for object schemas at top-level and nested levels) before tool dispatch.
- **OCAPI Query Coverage** (`src/core/tool-schemas/shared-schemas.ts`): Shared search schemas include `text_query`, `term_query`, `bool_query`, `filtered_query`, and `match_all_query` so MCP boundary validation aligns with supported OCAPI query patterns.
- **Handlers** (`src/core/handlers/`): Each category has a handler extending a common base for timing, structured logging, and error normalization, with config-driven wiring via `ConfiguredClientHandler` to reduce repetitive boilerplate (e.g. `log-handler`, `docs-handler`, `isml-handler`, `system-object-handler`).
- **Clients** (`src/clients/`): Encapsulate domain operations (OCAPI, SFRA docs, ISML docs, modular log analysis, script debugger, cartridge generation, agent-instruction sync). Handlers delegate to these so orchestration and computation remain separate.
- **Services** (`src/services/`): Dependency-injected abstractions for filesystem and path operations — improves testability and isolates side effects.
- **Modular Log System** (`src/clients/logs/`): Reader (range/tail optimization), discovery, processor (line → structured entry), analyzer (patterns & health), formatter (human output) for maintainable evolution.
- **Configuration Factory** (`src/config/configuration-factory.ts`): Determines capabilities (`canAccessLogs`, `canAccessOCAPI`) based on provided credentials and filters exposed tools accordingly (principle of least privilege).
- **Shared Credential Validation** (`src/config/credential-validation.ts`): Centralizes auth-pair completeness and hostname-format validation for both `dw.json` loading and runtime configuration creation.
- **Call-time Capability Guarding** (`src/core/server.ts`): Rejects execution of tools that are unavailable in the current mode, so hidden tools are not callable via direct `tools/call` requests.
- **Call Lifecycle Signals** (`src/core/server.ts`): `tools/call` handling supports cancellation via request abort signals and emits best-effort progress notifications when the caller provides `_meta.progressToken`.
- **Tool Error Sanitization** (`src/core/tool-error-response.ts`): Sanitizes upstream execution errors before returning MCP tool responses, reducing accidental leakage of backend payload details.
- **Runtime WebDAV Verification** (`src/core/server.ts`): For OAuth-only configurations (`client-id`/`client-secret` without `username`/`password`), log/job-log/script-debugger tool exposure is gated by a one-time WebDAV capability probe to avoid false-positive tool availability.
- **CLI Option Helpers** (`src/config/cli-options.ts`): Centralizes command-line parsing and environment credential detection for predictable startup behavior.
- **Shared Path Security Policy** (`src/config/path-security-policy.ts`): Reuses allow/block path rules across workspace-root discovery and secure `dw.json` loading.
- **Shared Abort Utility** (`src/utils/abort-utils.ts`): Centralized timeout and abort-signal composition used by HTTP and debugger clients for consistent cancellation semantics and timer cleanup.

### Why This Matters
- **Extensibility**: Adding a new tool usually means adding a schema + minimal handler logic (or a new handler if a new domain).
- **Security**: Tools that require credentials are never exposed when capability flags are false.
- **Testability**: Unit tests target clients & modules; integration/MCP tests validate handler routing and response structure.
- **Performance**: Tail log reads + lightweight caching (`cache.ts`, `log-cache.ts`) reduce unnecessary I/O.

### Adding a New Tool (High-Level)
1. Add schema to the appropriate file in `src/core/tool-schemas/` (or create new file for new category).
2. Export new schema from `src/core/tool-schemas/index.ts` if adding a new file.
3. Implement domain logic in a client/service (avoid bloating handlers).
4. Extend an existing handler or create a new one if it's a new category.
5. (Only for a new category) register the new handler inside `registerHandlers()` in `server.ts`.
6. Discover actual response shape with `npx aegis query` before writing tests.
7. Add Jest unit tests + YAML MCP tests (docs vs full mode if credentials required).
8. Update documentation (AGENTS.md + README counts if changed).

## 🤖 AI Interface Setup

Choose your preferred AI assistant:

| Interface | Best For | Setup Guide |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Claude Desktop** | Multi-turn conversations, debugging | [📖 Setup Guide](https://sfcc-mcp-dev.rhino-inquisitor.com/guide/ai-interfaces/) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | VS Code integration, inline suggestions | [📖 Setup Guide](https://sfcc-mcp-dev.rhino-inquisitor.com/guide/ai-interfaces/) |
| **Cursor** | Modern AI-powered editor | [📖 Setup Guide](https://sfcc-mcp-dev.rhino-inquisitor.com/guide/ai-interfaces/) |

## 📦 Installation

### Using npx (Recommended)
> Tip: Add `-y` (or `--yes`) to suppress the interactive prompt npx shows before downloading a package. This prevents AI clients (Claude Desktop, Copilot, Cursor) from hanging waiting for confirmation.
```bash
# Test the server
npx -y sfcc-dev-mcp

# Use with your configuration
npx -y sfcc-dev-mcp --dw-json /path/to/your/dw.json
```

### Global Installation
```bash
npm install -g sfcc-dev-mcp
sfcc-dev-mcp --dw-json /path/to/your/dw.json
```

## 🐛 Debug Mode & Logging

### Enable Debug Logging
```bash
# Enable debug mode for detailed logging
npx -y sfcc-dev-mcp --debug

# Or with configuration file
npx -y sfcc-dev-mcp --dw-json /path/to/your/dw.json --debug
```

`--debug` accepts `true/false`, `1/0`, or `yes/no`. Invalid values fail fast with a clear error message.

### Log File Locations

The server writes logs to your system's temporary directory:

- **macOS**: `/var/folders/{user-id}/T/sfcc-mcp-logs/`
- **Linux**: `/tmp/sfcc-mcp-logs/` 
- **Windows**: `%TEMP%\sfcc-mcp-logs\`

**Log Files Created:**
- `sfcc-mcp-info.log` - General application logs and startup messages
- `sfcc-mcp-debug.log` - Detailed debug information (only when `--debug` is enabled)
- `sfcc-mcp-error.log` - Error messages and stack traces
- `sfcc-mcp-warn.log` - Warning messages

### Finding Your Log Directory
```javascript
// The exact path varies by system - to find yours:
node -e "console.log(require('os').tmpdir() + '/sfcc-mcp-logs')"
```

## 🧪 Release Flow (Maintainers)

This repository now uses Changesets for npm releases.

When a change should ship in a new `sfcc-dev-mcp` version, add a changeset from the repository root:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

Check pending release state against `main` before merging:

```bash
npm run release:status
```

The release workflow on `main` creates or updates a release pull request from pending changesets. Merging that release pull request publishes the npm package through npm trusted publishing (GitHub Actions OIDC), waits for npm propagation, reruns MCP tests against the published NPX artifact, and then publishes the same version to the MCP Registry.

`npm run version-packages` also syncs `server.json` with the package version so `validate:server-json` keeps passing in the release PR.

Package publication now uses GitHub Actions OIDC trusted publishing, so no separate npm publish secret is required.

You can run the same validation locally:

```bash
# Ensure docs-site tool catalog stays in sync with runtime tool definitions
npm run validate:tools-sync

# Ensure docs-site skills catalog stays in sync with bundled skills
npm run validate:skills-sync

# Ensure MCP registry metadata stays in sync with package.json
npm run validate:server-json

# In a separate terminal, start the mock server first for full-mode MCP tests
npm run test:mock-server:start

# Uses latest published version by default
npm run test:mcp:published-npx

# Or pin a specific published version
bash ./scripts/test-published-npx.sh 1.0.21
```

In GitHub Actions, the publish workflow manages the mock server lifecycle automatically.
